// This file ('use-auth.ts') appears to be causing JSX parsing errors
// because it's a .ts file trying to interpret JSX-like syntax.
// The correct implementation with JSX should be in 'use-auth.tsx'.
// This file should ideally be DELETED.
// Making this file empty to prevent it from causing further compilation issues
// if it cannot be deleted through the current interface.

// Please ensure src/hooks/use-auth.tsx contains the correct AuthProvider logic.
